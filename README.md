since march 2023, with the launch of gpt-4, i've seen the immense potential ai holds. in august, i crafted a prototype for the toefl writing tutor. looking back, it seems rudimentary, yet it was quite beneficial, boosting my writing score from 22 to 25. it also aided friends like sam and alan in enhancing their writing abilities. **i aim for widespread access to this tutor, hoping it will simplify the process of improving writing skills and enhance teaching efficiency**. furthermore, my goal is to make the latest models accessible to everyone at ecic. the project is continuously evolving, and soon, you'll experience **a more personalized ai tutor** that remembers your writing style and preferences.

Unexpectedly, from the very beginning relying on open source project learning materials, we finally embarked on the road of independent development. I have always thought that the existing learning website tools are **not easy to use** ~~(especially Zhixuewang and Menkou)~~, but I hope we can change this... Maybe we can't do it very well, but I hope these attempts can change the form of the existing "education system" - from a combination of multiple independent functions, to **a integrated, truly efficiency-improving modern platform**.
