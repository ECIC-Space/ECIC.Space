## Introduction
This project aims to develop a next-generation platform for teachers and students, integrating AI to enhance accessibility and efficiency in education. The core mission is to bridge the information gap between students and teachers, and to optimize campus efficiency using data-driven insights.

## Features
1. **Dashboard Interface**: A control-panel-like interface that displays past learning data and pending assignments.
2. **Assignment Submission**: Users can submit assignments or create writings directly on the platform, with features like AI scoring, automate saving, grammar checking, and more.
3. **AI-driven Feedback**: Written assignments are graded by cutting-edged LLMs, which provides detailed improvement suggestions.
4. **Progress Tracking**: All user submissions are summarized and tracked by AI, offering detailed progress reports.

## Advantages
- **Modern Technology**: Built with modern technologies, fully encompassing features from legacy platforms.
- **Exclusive AI Automation**: Offers instant feedback on user inputs through automatic AI grading.
- **Personalized Reports**: Strong database support enables detailed analyses and improvement suggestions for each individual.
- **Automated Assessment**: Automated grading for fill-in-the-blank and short answer questions, reducing teachers' workload.

## Technology Stack
- **Backend**: Python with Flask framework; Peewee for database interactions; Celery for task queuing.
- **Frontend**: Developed using Vue.js with ElementPlus as the UI library.

## Words from core members

Perhaps we need a platform to store the common learning materials of students, to create a study base... In this way, we can **save the time of students and teachers**, and **better spread experience**...

since march 2023, when gpt-4 was released, i have saw the great potential that AI could bring to us. so i build the prototype of TOEFL Writing Tutor in august. although from todayâ€™s perspective, itâ€™s kinda bad, but still quite helpful (help me raise my writing score from 22 to 25). it also helped some of my friends like sam, alan, â€¦ in improving their writing skills. and **i hope generally available of this writing tutor can making it easier to improve writing and also leveraging teaching productivity**. whatâ€™s more, making the most cutting-edge models available to everyone in ECIC is also what i wish for.
the whole thing continues to iterate. you will have **more personalized AI tutor**, which has memory about what you write and how you write, in the near future.

Unexpectedly, from the very beginning relying on open source project learning materials, we finally embarked on the road of independent development. I have always thought that the existing learning website tools are **not easy to use** ~~(especially Zhixuewang and Menkou)~~, but I hope we can change this... Maybe we can't do it very well, but I hope these attempts can change the form of the existing "education system" - from a combination of multiple independent functions, to **a integrated, truly efficiency-improving modern platform**.
